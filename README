* Uses Drupal IOS SDK by Kyle Browning - https://github.com/workhabitinc/drupal-ios-sdk
* Uses Drupal 7 - http://www.drupal.org
* Uses ASIHTTPRequest - https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request
* Uses jQuery Mobile - http://jquerymobile.com/
* Uses Drupal PhoneGap Plugin for iOS - https://github.com/jefflinwood/Drupal-Plugin-for-PhoneGap-for-iOS


Edit DIOSConfig.h and replace the server name with your server name, and point it to your Services end point

You will need to configure Drupal 7.x to use Services 3.x, with the Plist Server, and with a REST endpoint
This app uses the Node, File, User, and Views resources. Views Resource is in a separate module.

Because login/logout with Services 3.x and sessions can be a little strange from PhoneGap, this is an area I'm working on.

The project is from XCode 4.2. I don't know if it will work in earlier versions of XCode.

Thanks for checking out this project!
